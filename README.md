## About Me

With a degree Computer science with Artificial Intelligence, recently graduated and eager to get into the field and earn practical experience in the field of software engineering. 

I particularly enjoy working with the programming language Java, where I have nurtured and facilitated an understanding of object-oriented design, data structures and software engineering principles through coursework and independent practice. 

During the later years of my degree, I had managed to accrue exposure to advanced topics pertaining to artificial intelligence, algorithmic problem solving and project-based development, in which I not only enjoy but am eager to apply to real-world problems.
